# Messenger-AI
### Messenger API with sentiment analysis and recommender system.

This project consisted on developing a messaging API that allows the interpretation of the sentiments within a public chat (Such as `Slack`), the idea is to meassure the level of happines of an specific group chat, using the `NLTK` network.

Applications for this software, could include business chat monitoring to measure happiness of employees, generating and automatically sending a report email to the Dept. of Human Resourses, for them to analyze when the happiness levels drops below a certain threshold (KPI).

We will also use a recommender system to predict which users who write about the same topics.
